# todo-list

My todo list

This Project allowed me to practice and apply the concepts and techniques taught in class. 

Upon completion of this TODO List, I was able  to:
   - Use Vue.js to create an app
   - Connect a Vue.js app to Supabase

the App is fully integrated with a Supabase database for users and tasks management.
My App is styled using CSS.
It is  deployed online with Netlify.

Features:

 - Registration of new users and sign in. The registration form requests an email address, phone number, password (6 characters minimum) and password confirmation from the user.

 - Enables the user to access his tasks list, to add, edit or delete tasks and logout.

 - All tasks are fetched from the logged-in userâ€™s task list stored in Supabase.

 - 2 ways of displaying tasks.

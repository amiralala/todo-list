   <h2>Project Goals</h2>
  

  This Project allowed me to practice and apply the concepts and techniques taught in class. 

  Upon completion of this TODO List, I was able  to:

   -Use Vue.js to create an app
   -Connect a Vue.js app to Supabase

   My app is  deployed online with Netlify
it is also fully integrated with a Supabase database using all CRUD operations.
I used Vue’s Pinia to fully implement status handling.
I included asynchronous operations using Promises and Async/await 
My App is styled using CSS


Features:

Create a sign up/sign  that will be displayed when the user is not logged in
Ensure that the signup form requests an email address, password (6 characters) and password confirmation from the user
Ensure that the sign in form requests an email and a password from the user
Create a page where after logging in, the user is shown the main app content
The app should fetch all tasks from the logged-in user’s task list stored in Supabase
